Recipe for Hamburgers: 

Season a quarter pound of ground beef. 

Smash it into a patty. 

Fry it in a skillet

And it's cooked once red juices stop flowing, but don't over cook patty.

Prepare slices of bread, add mayo, ketchup, mustard, hot sauce (if you want), and lettuce to the bread. 

Slap a piece of American Cheese on top of the warm patty and slide patty out of skillet and onto bread. 

Press both slices of bread together, and cut burger in half. 

Enjoy with fries, chips, coleslaw or some other side of your choice. Maybe a beer!!
